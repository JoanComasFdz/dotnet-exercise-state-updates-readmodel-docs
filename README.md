This repository serves as the main entry point for this exercise. It references other repositories where the code has been isolated to ease
the inspection and study of it.


## Exercise: Create a log from state changes in a functional way

In this project I will try to approach a little functionality I faced
recently, in a **functional** way.

This is a simplification and an abstraction of the actual functionality, not the full picture.
Do not critizie its architecture based on how would you have implemented it.

I will create also a traditional OOP implementation to be able to properly compare both approaches.

I consider traditional OOP to include SOLID principles.

## The functionality
The `hardware-connetion-monitor` service monitors the state of the connection to a hardware unit. When that
connection state changes, it publishes it with the hardware unit id, the new state and the current datetime.
The state can be `CONNECTED`, `DISCONNECTED` or `WAITING`.

The `system-reporter` service is listening to the `hardware-connetion-monitor` state changes and creates a log
of disconnections, which includes the hardware unit id, the state, the start time and the end time.

The log is created as follows:

1. If the last disconnection with the hardware unit id does not exist and the given state is not `CONNECTED`, 
 create a new disconnection with the given hardware unit id, state and the datetime as start time, leaveing end time null.

2. If the last disconnection with the hardware unit id exists and the end time is null, set its end time to the given datetime.

3. If the last disconnection with the hardware unit id exists and the given state is not `CONNECTED`,
 create a new disconnection with the given hardware unit id, state and the datetime as start time, leaveing end time null.

 > Important: There is no case where 2 events come with the same hardware unit id and the same state.

## Implementation constrains
- Only the `system-reporter` will be implemented.
- The events will be simulated via a Web API Controller.
- Since it is a read model, the data should be stored already in the way and format that will be returned when queried.
- Since it is a read model, the Controller method to return the log will not do any complex SQL query nor any in memory
 operation, besides obtaining the data from the DB and returning it. No mapping, no Linq, no loops, no ifs.

## My take on how to implement it
My goal is to create an impure-pure-impure sandwitch as follows:
1. Query the DB
2. Decide what to do
3. Update the DB accordingly

So all the logic to decide how the DB is updated should be in step 2, and it has to return everything that step 3 needs
to do all the DB updates.

To implement that I will try to do a descriminated union so that step 3 can do pattern matching. So let's look at the
cases:

Cases 1 and 3 tell me that it is the same action: Create a new disconnection and return it as action `AddNew`.

For case 2, the endTime has to be updated and returned as `UpdateLast`.
But case 2 and 3 are two consecutive things to do for 1 single event, for example:

> Event comes with state `WAITING` and a disconnection exists with end time `null`.

In this case, the actions are:
1. Update the last disconnection end time to the event datetime.
1. Add new disconnection with state `WAITING`, start time is the event datetime and end time is null.

Finally, there is a case in which the log only has to update the end time of the last disconnection: When the last end time is null and the event 
state is `CONNECTED`.

So, step 2 return 2 cases:
1. `AddNew`, which carries the new disconnection instance.
1. `UpdateLast` which carries the edited disconnection.
1. `UpdateLastEndTimeAndAddNew`, which carries the update disconnection and the new disconnection instance.

## Implementations

### oop: Traditional way
It has been implemented here:
- https://github.com/JoanComasFdz/dotnet-exercise-state-updates-readmodel-oop

## v1: First attempt at a functional approach
Here my goal is to isolate the business logic in a static, pure function, returning a discriminated union that I can switch over in the controller.

## My conclusions, v1
- I liked how the DetermineLogChanges ended up looking. It is quite self explanatory and clear. 
Variable names may be unconventional but help understanding the why.
- On the negative side, I wrote a comment before the last return because i realized it can be tricky
 to understand what is the combination of last disconnection, its end time and the event state.
 - Also, there is no way to know outside that method if all cases are being handled in the switch. I have tried
 with an enum, but then the code gets cumbersome since the type information is duplicated and the swtich needs to cast
 the `logChange` on every case.
 - Maybe its because I am rusty, but I needed to check the switch a number of times because I had some bugs there. I am not
 giving it a lot of importance,  but I need to keep this in mind.
 - USing this functional approach also forces you to create very small classes which are actually integral part of the method.
 this could be considered an unnecessary overhead by traditional OOP practicioners: *Why would I create extra types when I can simply
 call the DbContext here?* This is valid criticism, so more effort has to be put into explaining the benefits. I will need to add
 unit tests for the business logic to increase its justifiability.
- The traditional OOP implementation kinda forced me to create two seaprate variants for the MapPost:
  - Alternative 1: This is not 100% equivalent to the functional approach, since there is no other code in the ontroller than delegating all to the
 `LogService`. One of the reasons is because then the `LogService` can be tested in isolation, matching how the functinal approach is tested.
On the otherside, this is a 1:1 interface, meaning the LogUpdater itself could be injected, but most  SOLID enjoyers wouldn't like that,
even though there would not make much of a difference. The fact that the controller MapPost method becomes just a pass-trough method can be 
considered an unnecessary indirection or layer, only necessary to avoid integration test for ASP .NET Core.
  - Alternative 2: This is a more direct way to implement it, leaving all the code in the controller. It matches a bit better the functional
approach because there is actual code handling the DBContext. On the negative side, the tests must be done using the integration tests approach
for ASP .NET Core which is not as trivial as unit testing a class (even though its not that complex either).
- When it comes to testing the `LogService`, the following things are necessary:
  - A repository implementation to avoid having to use an InMemory DbContext (not a problem here since the DBContext is alreay in memory,
  but important to note it anywhat because production code won't have InMemory DBContexts). This repository is an unnecessary abstraction layer
  from a functionality point of view, but a requirement from a testing point of view. It is also a subpar solution, since for the case of
  update and add it is less performant because `db.SaveChanges()` is called twice. A potential fix would be to add a method in the repository
  to handle update and add, but then it begs the question: Should the repository really provide this functionality? If so, is the
  `LogService` leaking its implementation details?. Additinally, I won't write unit tests for the repository because they will have no return of
 investment. I know this may be a hot take, but what am I going to test? That Add adds the diconnection to the DbContext? This is so trivial.
  - A mocking framework for the unit tests. This is not really a big thing since everybody assumes this is always needed, but its important to remark
that it isn't necessary with the functional approach.
  - Creating the expected and input data is not enough, the mocking framework has to be used to configure the repository with the returning values.
  - In the OOP the coder MUST check that all the calls to the dependency are performed, and possibliy in a very particular order. It can be argued
  that the test is documenting the behaviour of the SUT. And yet, it feels like forced duplication, almost policing: did the dev of this class
  create a new isntance withouth checking if it already exist?

# v2: Use OneOf
As of November 2023, [OneOf](https://github.com/mcintyre321/OneOf) is the default library to use when implementing discriminated unions.

As a follow-up on the exercise, I have renamed the current system-reporter to system-reporter-v1 and created a v2 project, where
I replaced the custom implementation of DU by the tools available in OneOf.
 
 ## Conclusions, v2
- The DU types can be simplified since I no longer need to make them inherit from the same base.
- It could be argue that the Last and the Instance properties could be moved to a single one in LogChange base class, but that would
 decrease understandability because it would need a generic name that wont match either option.
- OneOf provides a Switch method, which is the one that will give you the ability to know if you missed a type on coding and compile time.
- This made me realized that I am passing the entity from DBContext into the business logic, so there is no need to get it again from DB,
i can just return the `last` parameter as part of the result type when needed. Its `EndTime` can therefore be updated outseide in the switch
and the changes will be made effective on `db.SaveChanges()`.
- Overall is less code and more compact.
- Unit testing can be improved, `IsT0` doesn't mean anything, I could use the switch methof there as well.
- How would stack traces look like if an exceptin happens in any of the lambdas in the `Switch()` method?

# v3: v2 with pattern matching
After further learning, I can condense all the ifs into 3 pattern matching statements, to compare how it reads and feels compared to v2.

## Conclusions, v3
- It gets rid of any variable naming, transforming statements into expressions.
- It needs some getting used to this way of writing code.
- C# syntax to do pattern matching over a tuple may not be the best one.
- In v2 I could have avoided writing variables, but I felt it would be easier to read and mantain; In v3 variable names aren't even possible,
lines feel too long, but at the same time there is a lot going on on a few lines of code.
- This feels truly different than anything I have donde before and closer to whatever functional code I see.
- Unit tests keep the same issue about `IsT0`. But I changed one of the unit tests to get a feeling of how would it lookt like with the switch.

# v4: v3 with no custom types
I want to try to implement it without the custom types, just returning a OneOf of several options.

## Conclusions, v4
- The `DetermineLogChanges` method looks neat, very compact, a lot going on in a few lines of code.
- Lines have been reduced down to 11 from 12 (method) + 15 (return types) = 27, meaning 60% less code.
- The readability of the method itself does not change much thanks to being able to name the properties of the tuples.
- As a consumer, I think the user experience is decreased: To properly use this method, I think it requires XML documentation, explaingin what each 
type in the OneOf represents or is for.
- This begs the question: Is it better to have a longer class and helper types with no XML doc or a shorter class with no helper types with XML doc?
Right now I am not sure.
- Unit tests keep the same issue about `IsT0`.

# v5: High order functions
The next follow-up is to invert the game: Replace discriminated unions by parameters of type `Actions<T>`, which will provide
the necessary functionality to the pure function.

This, in my opinion, implies changing the name of the function, since it no longer just determines something, but also calls
the necessary labdas to make it happen.

## Conclusions, v5
- It is an interesting exercise, but generates too many second-guesses.
- Readability of the `LogChanges` is more ore less the same, but when using only Funcs and Actions, a lot of information about how to use
the params is lost. Because of that I created the delegates with proper documentation. So the DU types are replaced by delegates.
- The testability of the `LogChanges` is decreased in my opinion, since "isCalled" and storage vars are needed just for the sake of checking
what has been done and what has not been done. This is similar to the traditional OOP version.
- The readability of the Controller, stays more or less the same once is written: its more compact but at the same time there are 4 lambdas
using the DbContext and their parameters are not really descriptive since they are named individually. I considered following the apporach of
"blablaBecauseOf" but that would create very long lambdas and all devs are used to short param names in lambdas.
- The writability in the Controller is decreased, because the dev has to understand what the hell are those lambdas for. IntelliSense isn't 
showing the XML documentation of the delegates so it does not help. A mitigation could be to declare the methods to be used in the lambdas...
but then the Controller explodes, which is exactly what I am trying to avoid.
- TL;DR I would **not** choose this approach for this particular use case.

# v6: Dunet instead of OneOf
Another library i recently discovered is [Dunet](https://github.com/domn1995/dunet), which has a different approach.

Let's imlement it with Dunet then.

Looks like Dunet uses newer verison of the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common and Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp that EF, so I had to run:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common --version 4.7.0
dotnet add package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp --version 4.7.0
```

Then I get the warnings for the different libs, but it builds and runs.

## Conclusions, v6
- I actually like this library a lot, it it a bit opinionated because it emulates how other languages are declaring DUs: with a base "name" that has
different defined values. So here I need a base record with the different valeus as othe records.
- The syntax is simple and easy to remember and a lot less verbose than OneOf, since I can return only the base type in any method.
- I like the apporach with the autogenerated extension methods (specially because it adds some extra methods with your DU's values names) but it can
add clutter to intelli sense (which is a complaint I have heard before).
- I also like that only 1 method (`Match()`) is used for both Actions and Funcs.
- For unit tests, I have used the autogenerated `MatchAddNew()` method, so that I keep the pattern amtching style syntax. It also gives me the false
option where the result is not of the epected type so I can add a check there.
- I have proposed to add a `Func<BaseUnionType>` as the second parameter so that the actual value can be used in the "false path": https://github.com/domn1995/dunet/issues/193 
- If I am only looking at working with DUs, I think I will use Dunet instead of OneOf.

# Sumary
I am going to count the files and lines of code to compare both approaches, so the following items are common in both solutions and won't be counted:
 - Disconnection
 - DisconnectionDBContext
 - Program

 How am I counting lines?
 - Lines **not** counted:
   - usings
   - namespaces
   - blank lines
   - for unit tests: only the lines inside the method signature.

  I am aware that the line comparison can be a bit tricky. For example i could write an if without curly braces and 
  "save 2 lines", or put the if and the statement together in the same line. This is just not how I would code it.
  All coding guidelines I have faced so far would not allow that.

## OOP
Production code items:
- ILogService => Not strictly necessary, 1:1 interface, 4 lines
- LogService => Not strictly necessary, but facilitates testability, 27 lines.
- IDisconnectionRepository => not necessary for prod, but for testing, 6 lines.
- DisconnctionRepository => overkill with pass-through methods and less performant unless details are leaked, 22(28) lines.
 Total: **59/65** lines.

Code in controller:
- MapPost() becomes a pass-through method, 1 line. Good if you fvor hexagonal architecture, doesn't reduce complexity otherwise.
- MapPost(2) forces integration tests for ASP .NET Core but gets rid of 78 lines in exchange for 22 lines in the method and not respecting SOLID.
  
Tests:
- Requires mocking framework to test business logic.
- First test requires 2 lines for instantiation and 1 line to assert the `repo.GetLast...()` is called.
- Second test requires additiinal 2 lines for repo setup.

Total lines needed: 
1. 1 (`MapPost()`) + 59/65 (items) + 13 (Test1) + 20 (Test2) = **93(99)**.
2. 22 (`MapPost()`) + 13 (Test1) + 20 (Test2) = **55**.

## Functional (v6)
Production code items:
- BusinessLogic => in parameters give some guardrails, but don't fully grant parameter inmutability, 12 lines
- DU LogChange => very small "result" type with all options, 7 lines

Total: **21** lines.

Code in controller:
- MapPost() handles data persistency optimizing calls to `db.SaveChanges()`, doesn't fit hexagonal architecture, 12 lines.

Tests:
- No additional packages to test the business logic.
- First test => 15 lines.
- Second test => 21 lines.

Total lines needed:
11 (`MapPost()`) + 21 (items) + 15 (Test1) + 21 (Test2) = **68**.

**Note**: with v4 (in case I like it in the future), the lines would be:
11 (`MapPost()`) + 11 (Items) + 15 (Test1) + 21 (Test2) = 48.

## TL;DR (when working with (small?) services)

Traditional OOP:
- Requires shallow classes and 1:1 interfaces that don't bring much value, they are there only to adhere to a particular architecture.
- It can be underperformant unless one class leaks details to another, thus potentially violating SOLID, although some engineeres would say that it 
doesn't violate it and that this is exactly what the Repository is supposed to do.
- There is a way to reduce that complexity, at the cost of having to write integration tests. This is not a big deal nowadays, but it feels wrong to
 bootstrap the whole service to test some functionality.

Functional:
- Requires an extra library for Discriminated Unions to work
- It gets rid of shallow classes and 1:1 interfaces.
- Requires 27%(32%) less code (93(99) to 68 lines) and none of the items are required by external factors (like testability).
- Testing business logic does not require an macking library nor any setup beyond what the method needs.

# We need to talk about SOLID.

And before that, we need to talk about some hot takes:

## 1st hot take: Controllers
It is generally assumed that no logic should go in anything that is an interface to the outside world, like a controller receving HTTP calls,
a subscription receiving events from a broker, console input, etc. In hexagonal architecture this are called Driving and Driven ports.

The main argument is that the isolated functionality can then be plugged to any of ports and it's completely isolated from technolog and infrastructure.

Is this really necessary for the most parts of the most apps?

This is a very important question, necessary to reason about the next statement:

**The general rule cannot be the one that covers the most extreme cases.**

If a piece of code in a service needs to respond to both a Controller and a Subscription, that is an exception, NOT the general rule.

Therefore, I consider that in most cases the drivers are responsible for the **full vertical implementation**.
They should **not** simply be passthrough methods delegating everything into a 
Servie class with a 1:1 interface that is only used by one given driver.

And whenever a piece of functionality needs to be plugged to more than one place, I argue that the best apporach is to 
place the full functionality into a shared library and use it in both places.

Find a balance: Of course, if your Controller has 5 endpoints and all of them have plenty of code, then that can be considered an
exception to the rule and an alternative can be implemented. I still would try to avoid putting everything away. Again, the most important
part is to find a balance.

TL;DR: I push for code to be in the controller.

## 2nd hot take: Repositories
Entity Framework is already an abstraction layer over your data persistence system. Looks like EF team considers the following:
- They expect you to use it in the deepest layers of your application
- They expect you to use a repository pattern with ypour LINQ queries.
- They expect you to use the repository for unit testing purposes.
- They expect you to use a real database for integration testing purposes.

Source: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/16470

It is also mentioned in that thread that DbContext is a Unit of Work implmenentation and that DBSet is a Repository implementation.

Most repositories I have read are shallow classes with 1:1 interfaces, used only in 1 place. They are simply name wrappers around
relatevely easy LINQ queries, meaning pass-through methods that bring almost no value. For complex queries, they are 
implemented either directly SQL statements or stored procedures.

I argue that any test on a Repository has practically no return of investment:
- Either it tests that the Add method adds an entity to a DBContext: This is so trivial, it's a waste of everybodys time.
- Or it verifies that an sql statement is... written correctly?

Exception to the rule: I have done complex in-memory LINQ queries, which I truly needed unit tests for to fully understand. For this ones,
I put them into a class, which in my case was called `XYZSorter`. I specifically avoided the word Repository, because it would
have opened the door to other devs putting stuff inside that wasn't really ment to be there.

If the only reasone why a Repository is used is to create tests without having to setup the DbContext, then I argue that
a better approach is to follow the impure-pure-impure pattern, so that the actual functionality can be tested
in isolation of the DbContext, and as a bonus, no mocking framework is needed.

TL;DR: I favor directly using the DbContext versus Repositories in the upper layers of an application.
If a query is complex, put that one in its own class with a more descriptive name than just `XYZRepository`.

## Now: SOLID
How does the functional approach (v3) adhere to the SOLID principles?

### Single Responsability Principle
> A class should have only one reason to change
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)

The `BusinessLogic` is responsible for determining how the log should be written:If there is a new state or a new rule, it will go inside.

The `Controller` class is responssible fully handling the event.

Functional does respect the single responsability principle.

Also, nothing stops you from encapsulating the handling of the results of the `BusinessLogic` class into another class that contains the pattern
matching, thus freeing the controller from that responsability. In that case the responsability of the controller would be: Orchestrating the
components to update the log.

### Open Close Principle
> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open�closed_principle)

Discriminated unions do pose a challenge for extensibility, as adding a new type to the union will require modifying all functions that pattern match
on that union. This seems to violate OCP as it stands. This is a limitation of using discriminated unions, and it's a trade-off for the type safety 
and clarity they provide.

Extending functionality might impact consumers, but this is not unique to functional programming.

By isolating impure operations, you can change the core logic (pure functions) of your application without altering
how it interacts with the outside world.

In this exercise, adding a new line, updating an existing one and updating previous + adding a new one may be enough for future functuionality.
Even if a new case appears (a new state for example) it most likely can be extended in the pure method without affecting the controller.

What would break consumers is if a different action has to be done in the DB, say a delete, or adding multiple lines.
This is not necessarily negative because:
- Only 1 consumer is affected.
- The change in the controller is trivial.
- No extra unit tests are needed.
- If Integration tests exist for the other cases, then they are needed for the new caseas anyway.
- The whole change will be atomic.

The OCP applies more naturally to object-oriented design, but functional programming emphasizes immutability, statelessness, ]
and function composition, which offer their own kinds of flexibility and maintainability.

In functional programming, the focus is often on building small, reusable, and composable pure functions. While this might 
mean that certain structures like discriminated unions are less flexible than their OOP counterparts, the overall design
of a functional program can still support a high degree of extensibility and modularity, albeit in a different way than
prescribed by OCP.

AS a follow-up, wold be great to understand how can this logic be implemented with smaller, reusable and composable functions.


### Liskov Substitution Principle
> A class may be replaced by a sub-class without breaking the program.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)

In OOP, LSP is often about subclassing and inheritance, whereas in FP, it's more about adhering to contracts defined by function signatures,
type systems, or data structures.

The key point here is **Substitutability**:

- When a function expects a base type; it should be able to handle all subtypes of this base type. The function should work correctly regardless of 
which subtype is passed as long as the subtype adheres to the contract of the base type.

- Higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments should be able to accept any function matching the expected signature.
This is similar to LSP in that a function can be replaced by another as long as it adheres to the expected input/output contract.

- FP's emphasis on immutability and avoiding side effects naturally aligns with LSP. Functions and operations in FP typically don't alter the state, 
which makes it easier to substitute one function or data type with another without unintended side effects.

### Inversion of Control
> A component may delegate a responsability to a different component that it can then call.
(Myself, because the wikipedia page is far too generic)

IoC in functional programming is less about frameworks taking control and more about how functions manage control flow, side effects, and dependencies.

The key point here is **Delegation** (or SRP!):

- In FP, higher-order functions are a natural form of IoC. You pass functions (logic) into other functions, which then call back into the logic you
provided at the points they deem appropriate. This is a form of IoC where the control of when and how a certain piece of code executes is inverted 
from the caller to the function being called.

- Using callbacks or continuation-passing style (CPS) is another way IoC manifests in FP. Instead of a function returning a value directly, it calls 
another function (a continuation) with the result, thus inverting the control over what happens after a computation is finished.

### Dependency Injection
> A component receives other components that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)

In FP, DI is typically about providing functions with the dependencies they need to perform their tasks, often without relying on complex DI frameworks.

The simplest and most common form of DI in FP is passing dependencies directly as function arguments

**Composition over Inheritance**: FP favors function composition over class inheritance. Dependencies are provided in a way that supports this 
compositional approach.

## TL;DR
SOLID Principles still apply in FP, they are just implemented in a different way.
